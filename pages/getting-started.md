## What is AI in Design?

Artificial Intelligence in design refers to using machine learning algorithms and automated systems to:

- Generate creative assets
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Analyze user behavior patterns
- Optimize design decisions

## Your First AI Design Tool

Let's start with a simple prompt for AI image generation:

{% codetabs examples=[
  {
    "language": "text",
    "label": "Basic Prompt",
    "code": "Create a minimalist logo for a tech startup,\nblue and white color scheme,\nclean typography"
  },
  {
    "language": "text",
    "label": "Advanced Prompt",
    "code": "Design a minimalist logo for 'DataFlow',\na B2B data analytics startup.\nStyle: Clean, professional, tech-forward\nColors: Navy blue (#1a365d) and white\nElements: Subtle data visualization hint\nFormat: Vector-ready, scalable"
  }
] %}
{% /codetabs %}

## Design Thinking + AI

The key is combining human creativity with AI capabilities:

```mermaid

    A[Human Insight] --> B[AI Generation]
    B --> C[Human Refinement]
    C --> D[Final Design]
    D --> A
```

{% diagram type="mermaid" content="

    A[Problem Definition] --> B[AI Research]
    B --> C[Concept Generation]
    C --> D[Prototype & Test]
    D --> E[Iterate]
    E --> C
" %}

## Next Steps

1. **Choose your first tool** - Start with one AI tool that fits your workflow
2. **Practice prompting** - Learn to communicate effectively with AI
3. **Set up your workspace** - Integrate AI tools into your design process
4. **Join the community** - Connect with other AI-powered designers

# Challenges & Principles

Designing with LLMs comes with a unique set of challenges, chief among them are **unpredictability** and the need for **higher-level abstractions**.

Before integrating AI, the first question to ask is: Should this action be powered by AI at all? Just because a response can be generated doesn’t mean it’s valuable, reliable, or even appropriate. Consider:

- Is the outcome useful across common cases?
- Can a good response be generated consistently?
- What’s the range of customizations or scenarios the system needs to handle?

In practice, designing with LLMs means dealing with common system behaviors:it's easy to _lose context too quickly_, keep _irrelevant references for too long_, or send _too much information without clear control_ over what’s actually needed. **Consistency is difficult.** Tools may trigger when they shouldn’t, or fail to trigger when they should. Even when they’re used, they don’t always select the right ones, even for identical tasks. Throughout, **there’s a constant tradeoff between guiding the model and letting it explore creatively**.

Unlike traditional UI design—where the focus is on arranging components for **predictable outcomes**, LLM design often involves **coordinating large sets of possible scenarios and responses**. Here are a few principles to keep in mind:

## The product is not chat

The product is not chat, it’s the flexibility of the system itself. We’re not building a chat UI. We’re building a system that can be accessed through chat. Think of it as an OS: it takes in diverse inputs and returns outputs like code, UI, or text. The current chat interface is just one surface—there are many others we can imagine. Our goal is to make the system itself flexible and composable.

## Design around events

Design around events, not just interfaces. This means going beyond surface-level affordances. We’re designing how inputs are interpreted, which skills are triggered, what outputs are expected, and when to spin up autonomous threads. It’s about shaping the system’s logic and behavior, not just its appearance.

## Balance openness and predictability

Maintaining trust and control in AI-driven processes is paramount, especially for professional tools. This may require providing transparency in reasoning and workflows, as well as guidance when AI doesn’t perform as expected. Ultimately, the end objective is not to integrate UI, but to build an exceptional product that people can trust in their day to day work.

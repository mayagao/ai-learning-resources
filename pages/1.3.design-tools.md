# Design with AI Tools

The best way to design with AI tools is to experiment and **build your own intuition** about which ones work best for different tasks. Model strengths can vary widely depending on your use case and personal preferences. For instance, you might find OpenAI models write more fluidly, while Claude models tend to perform better at coding. Even versions within the same family, like Claude 3.5 vs. 3.7, can differ in how well they follow instructions. Try different tools and see what fits your own needs and workflows.

## Prototyping

Great for quick iteration, though may fall short when fine-grained control is needed.

- **[V0](https://v0.dev/)**: Vercel's vibe coding offering, easy to share.
- **[Lovable](https://www.lovable.dev/)**: Great at converting mockups to code.

## Coding in IDEs

There are a lot of IDEs that support all these models including Copilot, Cursor, and Windsurf. [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-code) is another good option that's known to work better in large codebases.

- **[Claude 3.5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5)**: Great at small, well-scoped tasks.
- **[Claude 4 opus](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus)**: A balance between following instructions and creativity.
- **[Gemini 3.5](https://gemini.google.com/models/gemini-3.5-flash)**: Solid for planning, though may over-ask for clarification.
- **[o3](https://www.openai.com/o3/)**: Strong reasoning, similar behavior to Gemini 3.5.

## Frameworks

Helpful libraries and systems for building AI-powered applications.

- **[Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/)**: For building serverless AI apps on Vercel with streaming support.
- **[Zod](https://zod.dev/)**: Type-safe schema validation for prompt inputs/outputs.
- **[Supabase](https://supabase.com)**: Postgres + auth + file storage.
- **[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)**: A modular LLM orchestration framework with tools, memory, and agents.

## Research

In depth research by pulling resources from the web.

- **[Perplexity Comet Browser](https://comet.perplexity.ai/)** or **[Perplexity Pro](https://www.perplexity.ai/)**: $20/month for Pro.
- Claude or **[Claude Desktop](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-desktop)**: The desktop version is great at testing custom MCPs.
- **[ChatGPT Deep Research](https://www.perplexity.ai/)**: Available for both Pro $20/month and Max $200/month plans.
